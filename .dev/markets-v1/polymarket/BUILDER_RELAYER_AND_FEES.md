# BUILDER, RELAYER, AND FEES

**Status:** reviewed
**Owner:** platform-orchestrator
**Last updated:** 2026-07-25
**Product:** RetroPick Markets V1 — Wave 2 Polymarket Integration
**Wave:** 2 (implementation-grade upstream contract)

## Description

This document covers Builder attribution (`builder` bytes32 on V2 orders), gasless Relayer operations (deploy, approvals, CTF, neg-risk convert), and the CLOB V2 fee model (operator-set at match; not embedded in the signed order), plus RetroPick secret-handling rules. Polymarket is fee and settlement authority; RetroPick injects builder codes, previews disclosures, and calls Relayer from the server.

It sits in Wave 2 between wallet auth and order/CTF paths. Builder and Relayer API keys stay in server env/secret stores only; clients display fee estimates and never send obsolete V1 `POLY_BUILDER_*` HMAC headers. Relayer is gas sponsorship and submission—not a substitute for user authorization or a RetroPick matching layer.

Read this before enabling attributed trading or gasless CTF/funding paths, when migrating off V1 builder headers, or when fee-tier/rate-limit upstream docs change. It is not a place to invent fee contracts or Relayer URLs, and not a license to treat RetroPick as the venue fee recipient.

## 0. Developer intent (5W+1H)

Short orientation for implementers and agents. Read this before the normative sections below.

| Lens | Answer |
|------|--------|
| **Who** | BFF order assembly and relayer clients, ops holding Builder/Relayer API keys, product/UX for fee disclosure, `be-api` / `security` agents. |
| **What** | Builder attribution (`builder` bytes32 on V2 orders), gasless Relayer ops (deploy, approvals, CTF, neg-risk convert), and CLOB V2 fee model (operator-set at match; not in signed order). Secret handling rules for RetroPick. |
| **When** | Before enabling attributed trading or gasless CTF/funding paths; when migrating off V1 `POLY_BUILDER_*` HMAC headers; on fee-tier or rate-limit upstream changes. |
| **Where** | Spec: this doc (EV-010, EV-009, EV-001). Keys: server env / secret store only. Order path: BFF injects builder code; clients display fees only. Relayer: BFF → Polymarket Relayer endpoints. |
| **Why** | Attribution and gasless UX depend on Builder program; fee fields in signed orders are obsolete in V2. Mis-handling keys or embedding feeRateBps breaks matching and creates security incidents. RetroPick is not the fee/settlement authority — Polymarket is. |
| **How** | Obtain builder code from Polymarket Builders settings; inject on assemble; query fees via `getClobMarketInfo()` / fee endpoints; call relayer with Builder or Relayer API keys; enforce 25 submits/min; never put secrets in OpenAPI clients. |

### Worked example

**Happy path.** User previews a buy. BFF fetches market fee schedule and account tier (trailing 30-day volume), returns disclosure amounts to UI. Order struct includes builder code, omits removed V1 fee fields. User signs; BFF submits to CLOB with L2 auth. Separately, first-time user needs pUSD + CTF approvals: BFF submits relayer tx under Builder auth; user confirms any required EIP-712/relayer payload per wallet type. Volume appears on Builder leaderboard with documented lag.

**Failure / degraded.** Relayer rate limit exceeded → queue/backoff; do not burn user gas by falling back to unguided direct sends without UX consent. Missing Builder code → orders still may trade but lose attribution; product decides fail-closed vs warn. Client must not send `POLY_BUILDER_*` HMAC (V1). If fee endpoint unavailable, block aggressive marketables or show "fees unknown" and refuse silent zero-fee claims. Never invent fee contracts or addresses.

**Secret & fee boundaries**

| Item | Location | Client visible |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Builder code (bytes32) | BFF assemble | Optional attribution display |
| Relayer API key + address | Server only | No |
| Fee schedule | BFF → UI disclosure | Yes (amounts/tiers) |
| Match-time operator fee | Polymarket | Post-trade / preview estimate |

**Relayer-eligible ops (orientation):** Deposit Wallet deploy; token approvals; CTF split/merge/redeem; neg-risk convert. Each still respects wallet ACL and user intent — relayer is gas sponsorship + submission, not a substitute for user authorization. Fee tiers are account-volume based; UI copy must not promise fixed bps that Polymarket can change at match time.

**Anti-patterns:** embedding Builder secrets in Android; putting `feeRateBps` back on signed orders; treating RetroPick as fee recipient for venue match fees; inventing relayer URLs. Pair with [ORDER_LIFECYCLE.md](./ORDER_LIFECYCLE.md) for submit path and [POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md](./POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md) for CTF gasless ops.

**Ordering with other docs:** auth/session first, then fee preview + builder inject on assemble, then relayer for approvals/CTF. Do not enable gasless redeem before registry verification and wallet ACL are green. Leaderboard lag is expected — do not invent realtime attribution APIs.

**Fee disclosure UX:** preview must show that match fees are venue-operator-set and may differ from estimate; never label RetroPick as the matcher charging CLOB fees. Builder attribution is orthogonal to user fee tier.

**Key rotation:** treat Relayer/Builder credential rotation like production incidents — revoke, redeploy secrets, audit recent submits. Clients never participate in rotation.

**Related docs:** [ORDER_LIFECYCLE.md](./ORDER_LIFECYCLE.md), [AUTHENTICATION_AND_ACCOUNT_WALLETS.md](./AUTHENTICATION_AND_ACCOUNT_WALLETS.md), [POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md](./POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md).

## 5. Current state
Builder codes documented upstream; BFF not yet attaching `builder` field on orders.
## 6. Target design

### 6.1 Builder program (EV-010)

- **Builder code**: bytes32 on signed order — replaces V1 `POLY_BUILDER_*` HMAC headers.
- Obtain from polymarket.com → Settings → Builders.
- BFF injects builder code during order assembly; clients display fee disclosure only.
- Volume attribution on leaderboard (24h lag).

### 6.2 Relayer (EV-009)

Gas-free operations for authorized builders:

- Deposit Wallet deploy
- Token approvals
- CTF split/merge/redeem
- Neg risk convert

Auth: Builder API keys OR Relayer API keys (`RELAYER_API_KEY` + `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS`).

Rate limit: **25 submits / minute** (EV-011).

### 6.3 Fee model V2 (EV-001)

- Fees **not** embedded in signed order (`feeRateBps` removed).
- Operator-set at match time; query via `getClobMarketInfo()` / fee endpoints.
- Account tier based on trailing 30-day volume.

### 6.4 RetroPick configuration

| Secret | Storage | Rotation |
|--------|---------|----------|
| builder_code | env / secret manager | quarterly |
| builder_api_key | secret manager | on compromise |
| relayer keys | per-user encrypted | user rotation |

### 6.5 User disclosure

UI MUST show: effective fee rate estimate, builder attribution notice, gasless relayer ops labeled "network fee covered by Polymarket".

## 7. Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Rejected because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Direct Gamma/CLOB from web/Android in production | ADR-002: schema churn, credential exposure, no central policy |
| Custom RetroPick exchange | ADR-001: Polymarket is venue authority |
| CLOB V1 SDK or V1-signed orders | EV-001: not supported on production after 2026-04-28 |
| USDC.e as default trading collateral post-V2 | EV-007: pUSD is V2 collateral |
| Hard-coded contract addresses without registry | EV-008: must verify at startup from official registry |
| Single `walletAddress` API field | ADR-003: conflates signer and account wallet |
| Combos trading in V1 | EV-013: incomplete upstream + legal/ops risk |
| Floating-point money in APIs | Precision loss; use fixed-point strings |
## 8. Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D-01 | Polymarket is venue authority for matching, resolution, collateral | ADR-001 |
| D-02 | All production upstream HTTP/WebSocket from BFF only | ADR-002 |
| D-03 | User signs orders and asset txs; BFF never silent-signs | ADR-003 |
| D-04 | Shared OpenAPI contract for web and Android | ADR-004 |
| D-05 | `eligible: false` blocks all mutating trading endpoints | Fail closed |
| D-06 | Order submit timeout → `unknown_reconciling`, never auto-resubmit | Reconciliation safety |
| D-07 | Exchange selection from official market metadata, not titles | EV-012 |
| D-08 | Combos capability remains disabled until gate checklist passes | EV-013 |
| D-09 | Contract addresses loaded from EV-008 registry with bytecode verify | No invented addresses |
| D-10 | Builder code attached server-side during order preview assembly | EV-010 |
## 9. Data and control flows
Order path: BFF sets `builder` bytes32 from config → included in EIP-712 → credited on match.
Relayer path: BFF batches approvals/CTF ops → POST relayer `/submit` → poll tx id.
## 10. Failure and recovery

| Failure domain | Detection | User-visible behavior | Recovery action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Gamma unavailable | 5xx, timeout, error rate | Stale catalog + banner | Serve cache; exponential backoff |
| CLOB market data down | /book errors | Empty book + retry CTA | Poll with jitter; fallback REST |
| CLOB L2 auth invalid | 401/403 | Re-auth prompt | L1 signature flow |
| Order submit timeout | client/BFF timer | `unknown_reconciling` state | Poll open orders + fills; user confirm |
| Relayer 429 | 429 response | Funding pending | Queue; respect 25/min submit limit |
| Bridge delay | status API stuck | In-progress funding UI | Poll bridge status; support playbook |
| Geo block | geoblock endpoint / policy | Read-only mode | Unsupported region UX |
| Registry mismatch | startup probe | Deploy blocked | Roll back config; ops alert |
| Engine restart | missing resting orders | Open orders may vanish upstream | Reconcile to cancelled or re-listed |

**MUST NOT:** silently resubmit orders after HTTP timeout; mark failed without reconciliation poll.
## 11. Security

- RetroPick MUST NOT receive, generate, store, log, or back up user seed phrases or raw private keys (ADR-003).
- Preview-before-sign for every collateral wrap, approval, transfer, split, merge, convert, redeem, withdrawal.
- Builder codes, relayer API keys, and CLOB L2 secrets: server-side only; never in mobile/web bundles.
- Production clients MUST NOT embed upstream base URLs for authenticated CLOB/relayer calls (ADR-002).
- Signed payload hash stored for audit; full signature redacted in logs.
- Session binding for web; Android attestation where platform supports it.
## 12. Observability

| Metric | Type | SLO / alert |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `markets_upstream_request_duration_ms` | histogram | p95 per upstream |
| `markets_upstream_errors_total` | counter | >1% 5m window |
| `markets_catalog_staleness_seconds` | gauge | >300s page |
| `markets_order_reconcile_lag_seconds` | histogram | p99 < 60s |
| `markets_capability_denied_total` | counter | anomaly detection |
| `markets_degraded_mode` | gauge | ==1 for 5m |

Structured logs: `correlation_id`, `user_session_id` (hashed), `upstream`, `evidence_id`, `operation`. Never log private keys, mnemonics, relayer secrets, or full EIP-712 payloads.
## 13. Test strategy

- **Contract:** OpenAPI conformance (EV-005) for every BFF route in this document's scope.
- **Integration:** Recorded cassettes against Gamma/CLOB/Data/Bridge sandboxes; no secrets in CI.
- **Security:** Signing boundary tests — BFF cannot produce valid order signature without client.
- **E2E:** [testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md](../testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md).
- **Chaos:** Upstream 429/5xx injection; verify degraded mode and no double-submit.
- **Registry:** Startup test with known-good and intentionally wrong bytecode hash.
## 14. Rollout and rollback

1. **Phase 1:** catalog + market data capabilities (`read_only`).
2. **Phase 2:** wallet connect + funding (`wallet`, `funding`).
3. **Phase 3:** order submit behind kill switch (`trade`).
4. **Phase 4:** portfolio, redemption, neg-risk convert (`portfolio`).

Rollback: flip capability flag in BFF config → clients poll `/markets/capabilities` (TTL ≤30s). Order kill switch stops new submits; does **not** cancel upstream resting orders.
