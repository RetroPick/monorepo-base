# UPSTREAM CHANGE MANAGEMENT

**Status:** reviewed
**Owner:** platform-orchestrator
**Last updated:** 2026-07-25
**Product:** RetroPick Markets V1 — Wave 2 Polymarket Integration
**Wave:** 2 (implementation-grade upstream contract)

## Description

This document defines the process to detect, assess, and respond to Polymarket upstream changes that affect Markets V1: docs/changelog, SDK releases, contract registry diffs, rate limits, and geoblock policy—with evidence refresh, severity classification, and deploy freezes. V1 has no custom exchange to absorb protocol drift.

It sits across the Wave 2 suite as the operational companion to the API and contract registries and `research/EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md`. Breaking API or address changes trigger 24h assessment and trading-deploy freezes; rate-limit tightening is tuned within policy, not evaded. Combos GA announcements do not auto-enable Combos—the capability gate still applies.

Read this for weekly/monthly watch cadence, before any “just update the URL” shortcut, and when agents refresh evidence after changelog events. It is not a place to invent fallback hosts or hot-patch addresses from unofficial sources.

## 0. Developer intent (5W+1H)

Short orientation for implementers and agents. Read this before the normative sections below.

| Lens | Answer |
|------|--------|
| **Who** | Platform/docs owners, backend SDK consumers, compliance (geoblock), release managers, agents updating evidence after Polymarket changelog events. |
| **What** | Process to detect, assess, and respond to upstream changes: docs/changelog, SDK releases, contract registry diffs, rate limits, geoblock policy — with evidence refresh and deploy freezes. |
| **When** | Weekly watches (docs, SDK, registry, llms.txt); monthly geoblock; immediately on breaking API or address changes (24h assess). Before any "just update the URL" shortcut. |
| **Where** | Watch sources listed in this doc; evidence in `research/EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md` / yaml; registries in [CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md](./CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md) and [API_SDK_AND_ENDPOINT_REGISTRY.md](./API_SDK_AND_ENDPOINT_REGISTRY.md). |
| **Why** | Polymarket can change ACL, fees, domains, or contracts without RetroPick commits. Stale evidence causes invented endpoints/addresses and production outages. V1 has no custom exchange to absorb protocol drift. |
| **How** | Diff watch sources; classify severity; freeze deploy on breaking changes; re-fetch authoritative URLs; bump evidence dates/confidence; ADR if architectural; re-run conformance; keep Combos excluded until gate reopened. |

### Worked example

**Happy path.** Weekly job diffs docs changelog + contract page. New fee field documented → update fee section in Builder/Fees doc, refresh EV dates, adjust BFF fee preview, run order lifecycle tests. SDK minor bump → conformance suite green → dependabot merge. Registry address unchanged, bytecode still matches → no action.

**Failure / degraded.** CLOB breaking auth change mid-release → 24h assess, freeze trading deploy, patch BFF, revalidate geoblock. New contract address on docs → update registry with evidence, verify bytecode, do **not** hot-patch from Twitter. Rate-limit tightening → tune token buckets within 48h; degrade traffic rather than ban evasion. Agent "fixes" by inventing fallback host → reject. Combos GA announcement → does **not** auto-enable; still [COMBOS_CAPABILITY_GATE.md](./COMBOS_CAPABILITY_GATE.md).

**Response SLAs (summary)**

| Category | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Breaking API | 24h assess; freeze; patch |
| New contract address | 24h; registry + bytecode |
| Rate limits | 48h tune |
| SDK major | ~1 week conformance |
| Deprecation | Plan to upstream timeline |

**Evidence refresh protocol (orientation)**

1. Re-fetch the authoritative URL (not a mirror).
2. Update evidence `retrieved` date and confidence.
3. If a claim changed, patch the owning polymarket doc and bump matrix/OpenAPI as needed.
4. File an ADR when trust boundaries or architecture shift.
5. Refuse merges that introduce hosts/addresses without evidence IDs.

This process protects wallets, order lifecycle, CTF, funding, fees, neg-risk routing, and the Combos gate alike — every peer doc assumes evidence freshness.

**Related docs:** every peer in `polymarket/`; evidence register; capability matrix for ship gates.

## 1. Purpose

## 5. Current state
Manual review; no automated registry diff in CI.
## 6. Target design

### 6.1 Watch sources

| Source | Check frequency | Owner |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| https://docs.polymarket.com/changelog | weekly | platform |
| `@polymarket/clob-client-v2` releases | weekly | backend |
| Contract registry page diff | weekly | backend |
| `llms.txt` index diff | weekly | docs |
| Geoblock policy | monthly | compliance |

### 6.2 Change categories

| Category | Response time | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| breaking API | 24h assess | freeze deploy; patch BFF |
| new contract address | 24h | update registry; verify bytecode |
| rate limit change | 48h | tune token buckets |
| SDK major | 1 week | conformance run |
| deprecation notice | per timeline | migration plan |

### 6.3 Evidence refresh protocol

1. Re-fetch authoritative URL.
2. Update `evidence-register.yaml` entry `retrieved` date.
3. If claim changed: bump confidence, file ADR if architectural.
4. Run `tools/verify-polymarket-registry` (planned) in CI.

### 6.4 Emergency rollback

Upstream contract incident: disable `trade` capability → drain relayer queue → communicate via status page.

### 6.5 Version pinning

| Artifact | Pin |
|----------|-----|
| Go modules | go.sum |
| ABI tags | git tag in abi metadata |
| OpenAPI | markets-v1.yaml version field |
| Evidence register | last_updated |

## 7. Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Rejected because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Direct Gamma/CLOB from web/Android in production | ADR-002: schema churn, credential exposure, no central policy |
| Custom RetroPick exchange | ADR-001: Polymarket is venue authority |
| CLOB V1 SDK or V1-signed orders | EV-001: not supported on production after 2026-04-28 |
| USDC.e as default trading collateral post-V2 | EV-007: pUSD is V2 collateral |
| Hard-coded contract addresses without registry | EV-008: must verify at startup from official registry |
| Single `walletAddress` API field | ADR-003: conflates signer and account wallet |
| Combos trading in V1 | EV-013: incomplete upstream + legal/ops risk |
| Floating-point money in APIs | Precision loss; use fixed-point strings |
## 8. Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D-01 | Polymarket is venue authority for matching, resolution, collateral | ADR-001 |
| D-02 | All production upstream HTTP/WebSocket from BFF only | ADR-002 |
| D-03 | User signs orders and asset txs; BFF never silent-signs | ADR-003 |
| D-04 | Shared OpenAPI contract for web and Android | ADR-004 |
| D-05 | `eligible: false` blocks all mutating trading endpoints | Fail closed |
| D-06 | Order submit timeout → `unknown_reconciling`, never auto-resubmit | Reconciliation safety |
| D-07 | Exchange selection from official market metadata, not titles | EV-012 |
| D-08 | Combos capability remains disabled until gate checklist passes | EV-013 |
| D-09 | Contract addresses loaded from EV-008 registry with bytecode verify | No invented addresses |
| D-10 | Builder code attached server-side during order preview assembly | EV-010 |
## 9. Data and control flows
Weekly cron diffs registry + llms.txt → opens tracking issue if changed → triggers evidence revalidation.
## 10. Failure and recovery

| Failure domain | Detection | User-visible behavior | Recovery action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Gamma unavailable | 5xx, timeout, error rate | Stale catalog + banner | Serve cache; exponential backoff |
| CLOB market data down | /book errors | Empty book + retry CTA | Poll with jitter; fallback REST |
| CLOB L2 auth invalid | 401/403 | Re-auth prompt | L1 signature flow |
| Order submit timeout | client/BFF timer | `unknown_reconciling` state | Poll open orders + fills; user confirm |
| Relayer 429 | 429 response | Funding pending | Queue; respect 25/min submit limit |
| Bridge delay | status API stuck | In-progress funding UI | Poll bridge status; support playbook |
| Geo block | geoblock endpoint / policy | Read-only mode | Unsupported region UX |
| Registry mismatch | startup probe | Deploy blocked | Roll back config; ops alert |
| Engine restart | missing resting orders | Open orders may vanish upstream | Reconcile to cancelled or re-listed |

**MUST NOT:** silently resubmit orders after HTTP timeout; mark failed without reconciliation poll.
## 11. Security

- RetroPick MUST NOT receive, generate, store, log, or back up user seed phrases or raw private keys (ADR-003).
- Preview-before-sign for every collateral wrap, approval, transfer, split, merge, convert, redeem, withdrawal.
- Builder codes, relayer API keys, and CLOB L2 secrets: server-side only; never in mobile/web bundles.
- Production clients MUST NOT embed upstream base URLs for authenticated CLOB/relayer calls (ADR-002).
- Signed payload hash stored for audit; full signature redacted in logs.
- Session binding for web; Android attestation where platform supports it.
## 12. Observability

| Metric | Type | SLO / alert |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `markets_upstream_request_duration_ms` | histogram | p95 per upstream |
| `markets_upstream_errors_total` | counter | >1% 5m window |
| `markets_catalog_staleness_seconds` | gauge | >300s page |
| `markets_order_reconcile_lag_seconds` | histogram | p99 < 60s |
| `markets_capability_denied_total` | counter | anomaly detection |
| `markets_degraded_mode` | gauge | ==1 for 5m |

Structured logs: `correlation_id`, `user_session_id` (hashed), `upstream`, `evidence_id`, `operation`. Never log private keys, mnemonics, relayer secrets, or full EIP-712 payloads.
## 13. Test strategy

- **Contract:** OpenAPI conformance (EV-005) for every BFF route in this document's scope.
- **Integration:** Recorded cassettes against Gamma/CLOB/Data/Bridge sandboxes; no secrets in CI.
- **Security:** Signing boundary tests — BFF cannot produce valid order signature without client.
- **E2E:** [testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md](../testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md).
- **Chaos:** Upstream 429/5xx injection; verify degraded mode and no double-submit.
- **Registry:** Startup test with known-good and intentionally wrong bytecode hash.
## 14. Rollout and rollback

1. **Phase 1:** catalog + market data capabilities (`read_only`).
2. **Phase 2:** wallet connect + funding (`wallet`, `funding`).
3. **Phase 3:** order submit behind kill switch (`trade`).
4. **Phase 4:** portfolio, redemption, neg-risk convert (`portfolio`).

Rollback: flip capability flag in BFF config → clients poll `/markets/capabilities` (TTL ≤30s). Order kill switch stops new submits; does **not** cancel upstream resting orders.
## 15. Open questions
