# NEGATIVE RISK AND AUGMENTED MARKETS

**Status:** reviewed
**Owner:** platform-orchestrator
**Last updated:** 2026-07-25
**Product:** RetroPick Markets V1 — Wave 2 Polymarket Integration
**Wave:** 2 (implementation-grade upstream contract)

## Description

This document specifies negative-risk multi-outcome mechanics, augmented placeholders/“Other” rules, detection via official `negRisk` fields, adapter `convert` semantics, and BFF trading rules for Markets V1 Wave 2. Venue rules are Polymarket’s; RetroPick must not infer neg-risk from titles or invent adapter addresses.

It sits in Wave 2 between catalog ingest, order assembly, and CTF/relayer paths. Orders for `negRisk: true` markets bind to the Neg Risk CTF Exchange domain from the verified contract registry; standard markets use Exchange V2. Placeholders stay hidden until named; aggressive “Other” trading against upstream guidance is blocked.

Read this for any market with `negRisk: true`, before signing (domain/exchange selection), and before offering convert UX. Prefer [CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md](./CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md) for addresses and [POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md](./POSITIONS_CTF_AND_REDEMPTION.md) for post-convert portfolio refresh—not for title heuristics or Combos.

## 0. Developer intent (5W+1H)

Short orientation for implementers and agents. Read this before the normative sections below.

| Lens | Answer |
|------|--------|
| **Who** | Catalog ingest + order assembly engineers, market UI, agents selecting Exchange vs Neg Risk Exchange, CTF convert/relayer callers. |
| **What** | Negative-risk multi-outcome mechanics, augmented placeholders/"Other" rules, detection via official `negRisk` fields, adapter `convert` semantics, and BFF trading rules. |
| **When** | Any market with `negRisk: true`; before signing orders (domain/exchange selection); before offering convert UX; when EV-012 guidance updates. |
| **Where** | Spec: this doc. Flags: Gamma/CLOB `getClobMarketInfo()`. Settlement: Neg Risk CTF Exchange + adapter per [CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md](./CONTRACT_ABI_AND_ADDRESS_REGISTRY.md) (verify — do not invent). |
| **Why** | Wrong exchange or treating No-on-A as ordinary binary breaks settlement. Inferring neg-risk from titles causes mis-routing. Augmented "Other"/placeholders are easy to mis-trade. Venue rules are Polymarket's. |
| **How** | Detect only via official fields; route orders to Neg Risk exchange when flagged; expose convert via relayer/CTF paths; UI trades named outcomes; hide placeholders until named; avoid direct "Other" trading per upstream guidance. |

### Worked example

**Happy path.** Ingest sets `negRisk` from Gamma. UI shows multi-outcome event. User buys Yes on outcome B; BFF selects Neg Risk CTF Exchange domain for EIP-712. Later user holds No on A and converts → Yes on all other outcomes via documented adapter `convert`, optionally gasless through relayer. Named outcomes only appear as primary tickets; placeholders stay hidden.

**Failure / degraded.** Title contains "election" so agent sets `negRisk=true` without field → reject. Order signed against standard CTF Exchange for a neg-risk market → upstream reject / funds risk — assembly tests must bind exchange to flags. Trading placeholder or "Other" aggressively against guidance → product block. Missing registry verification for Neg Risk exchange → trading blocked. Combos remain unrelated and excluded.

**Routing rules (agents)**

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `negRisk: true` | Use Neg Risk exchange + domains |
| `negRisk: false` / absent | Standard Exchange V2 |
| Placeholder outcomes | Hide until named |
| Infer from title | **Forbidden** |

**Convert semantics (orientation):** under negative risk, a No share in market A can convert into Yes shares across the complementary outcomes via the Neg Risk adapter — this is venue inventory math, not a RetroPick inventiveness layer. UI must explain convert as a Polymarket operation. Augmented markets add named outcomes + placeholders + explicit Other; follow Polymarket guidance to prefer named outcomes and keep placeholders non-tradable until clarified.

**Test focus:** golden fixtures should cover (a) standard market → Exchange V2 domain, (b) `negRisk: true` → Neg Risk exchange domain, (c) title-only heuristic rejected, (d) placeholder outcomes hidden. Convert tests belong with relayer/CTF, not with inventing adapter addresses.

**Portfolio coupling:** after convert, position projections must refresh from Data API/on-chain before offering another convert or redeem. Do not locally synthesize Yes bags without venue confirmation.

**Augmented market UX:** show event-level mutual exclusivity; explain that only one outcome wins. Keep "Other" education copy short and non-gambling. Placeholders must not appear as priced tickets until named by venue metadata.

**Registry dependency:** never embed Neg Risk exchange literals in order code — load from the verified contract registry after bytecode checks.

## 5. Current state
Flags not yet parsed from Gamma ingest.
## 6. Target design

### 6.1 Negative risk (EV-012)

Multi-outcome events where only one wins. **No** share in market A converts to Yes in all other markets via Neg Risk Adapter.

- Uses **Neg Risk CTF Exchange** (`0xe222...` per EV-008 — verify at impl).
- `convert` operation: 1 No on outcome A → 1 Yes on every other outcome.

### 6.2 Detection

Use official fields from Gamma/CLOB `getClobMarketInfo()`:

- `negRisk: true`
- `negRiskMarketID` / event grouping

**MUST NOT** infer from titles.

### 6.3 Augmented negative risk

- Named outcomes + placeholders + explicit Other.
- **Trade named outcomes only** per Polymarket guidance.
- Placeholders hidden in UI until named.
- Avoid trading "Other" directly — definition narrows as placeholders clarify.

### 6.4 BFF behavior

| Condition | UI/BFF |
|-----------|--------|
| placeholder outcome | exclude from trade picker |
| neg_risk convert available | show convert preview |
| standard market | standard exchange |

## 7. Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Rejected because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Direct Gamma/CLOB from web/Android in production | ADR-002: schema churn, credential exposure, no central policy |
| Custom RetroPick exchange | ADR-001: Polymarket is venue authority |
| CLOB V1 SDK or V1-signed orders | EV-001: not supported on production after 2026-04-28 |
| USDC.e as default trading collateral post-V2 | EV-007: pUSD is V2 collateral |
| Hard-coded contract addresses without registry | EV-008: must verify at startup from official registry |
| Single `walletAddress` API field | ADR-003: conflates signer and account wallet |
| Combos trading in V1 | EV-013: incomplete upstream + legal/ops risk |
| Floating-point money in APIs | Precision loss; use fixed-point strings |
## 8. Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D-01 | Polymarket is venue authority for matching, resolution, collateral | ADR-001 |
| D-02 | All production upstream HTTP/WebSocket from BFF only | ADR-002 |
| D-03 | User signs orders and asset txs; BFF never silent-signs | ADR-003 |
| D-04 | Shared OpenAPI contract for web and Android | ADR-004 |
| D-05 | `eligible: false` blocks all mutating trading endpoints | Fail closed |
| D-06 | Order submit timeout → `unknown_reconciling`, never auto-resubmit | Reconciliation safety |
| D-07 | Exchange selection from official market metadata, not titles | EV-012 |
| D-08 | Combos capability remains disabled until gate checklist passes | EV-013 |
| D-09 | Contract addresses loaded from EV-008 registry with bytecode verify | No invented addresses |
| D-10 | Builder code attached server-side during order preview assembly | EV-010 |
## 9. Data and control flows
Ingest stores `neg_risk` on market row → order preview selects verifyingContract + exchange.
## 10. Failure and recovery

| Failure domain | Detection | User-visible behavior | Recovery action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Gamma unavailable | 5xx, timeout, error rate | Stale catalog + banner | Serve cache; exponential backoff |
| CLOB market data down | /book errors | Empty book + retry CTA | Poll with jitter; fallback REST |
| CLOB L2 auth invalid | 401/403 | Re-auth prompt | L1 signature flow |
| Order submit timeout | client/BFF timer | `unknown_reconciling` state | Poll open orders + fills; user confirm |
| Relayer 429 | 429 response | Funding pending | Queue; respect 25/min submit limit |
| Bridge delay | status API stuck | In-progress funding UI | Poll bridge status; support playbook |
| Geo block | geoblock endpoint / policy | Read-only mode | Unsupported region UX |
| Registry mismatch | startup probe | Deploy blocked | Roll back config; ops alert |
| Engine restart | missing resting orders | Open orders may vanish upstream | Reconcile to cancelled or re-listed |

**MUST NOT:** silently resubmit orders after HTTP timeout; mark failed without reconciliation poll.
## 11. Security

- RetroPick MUST NOT receive, generate, store, log, or back up user seed phrases or raw private keys (ADR-003).
- Preview-before-sign for every collateral wrap, approval, transfer, split, merge, convert, redeem, withdrawal.
- Builder codes, relayer API keys, and CLOB L2 secrets: server-side only; never in mobile/web bundles.
- Production clients MUST NOT embed upstream base URLs for authenticated CLOB/relayer calls (ADR-002).
- Signed payload hash stored for audit; full signature redacted in logs.
- Session binding for web; Android attestation where platform supports it.
## 12. Observability

| Metric | Type | SLO / alert |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `markets_upstream_request_duration_ms` | histogram | p95 per upstream |
| `markets_upstream_errors_total` | counter | >1% 5m window |
| `markets_catalog_staleness_seconds` | gauge | >300s page |
| `markets_order_reconcile_lag_seconds` | histogram | p99 < 60s |
| `markets_capability_denied_total` | counter | anomaly detection |
| `markets_degraded_mode` | gauge | ==1 for 5m |

Structured logs: `correlation_id`, `user_session_id` (hashed), `upstream`, `evidence_id`, `operation`. Never log private keys, mnemonics, relayer secrets, or full EIP-712 payloads.
## 13. Test strategy

- **Contract:** OpenAPI conformance (EV-005) for every BFF route in this document's scope.
- **Integration:** Recorded cassettes against Gamma/CLOB/Data/Bridge sandboxes; no secrets in CI.
- **Security:** Signing boundary tests — BFF cannot produce valid order signature without client.
- **E2E:** [testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md](../testing/END_TO_END_CRITICAL_JOURNEYS.md).
- **Chaos:** Upstream 429/5xx injection; verify degraded mode and no double-submit.
- **Registry:** Startup test with known-good and intentionally wrong bytecode hash.
## 14. Rollout and rollback

1. **Phase 1:** catalog + market data capabilities (`read_only`).
2. **Phase 2:** wallet connect + funding (`wallet`, `funding`).
3. **Phase 3:** order submit behind kill switch (`trade`).
4. **Phase 4:** portfolio, redemption, neg-risk convert (`portfolio`).

Rollback: flip capability flag in BFF config → clients poll `/markets/capabilities` (TTL ≤30s). Order kill switch stops new submits; does **not** cancel upstream resting orders.
