# Shortcuts

> Keyboard shortcut mappings for TUI menu navigation.

## Overview

This module defines a static `SHORTCUTS` dictionary that maps key strings to action names, plus a `get_action()` lookup helper. It represents an earlier, simpler shortcut system. The authoritative dispatch table used at runtime is `SCREEN_ROUTES` in `controller.py`, which maps directly to screen functions and covers far more entries.

## Key Classes / Functions

### `SHORTCUTS`

A dictionary mapping single characters and words to action name strings:

- Number keys `'1'`-`'7'` map to core screens (monitor, whales, watch, analytics, portfolio, export, settings).
- Letter shortcuts `'m'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'p'`, `'e'`, `'s'` duplicate the number mappings.
- `'h'`, `'?'` map to `'help'`; `'q'`, `'exit'`, `'quit'` map to `'quit'`.

### `get_action(key: str) -> str`

Looks up a key in `SHORTCUTS`. Returns the mapped action name, or the original key unchanged if no mapping exists.

## Configuration

None. The mappings are hardcoded.

## Architecture Role

This module is a legacy utility. The controller's `SCREEN_ROUTES` dictionary has superseded it for actual screen dispatch, but `shortcuts.py` remains available for any code that needs to resolve a key press to a logical action name.

## Related Modules

- [controller](../infrastructure/controller.md) -- `SCREEN_ROUTES` is the active dispatch table
- [menu](../infrastructure/menu.md) -- handles pagination shortcuts (`m`, `b`) directly

## Documentation Maintenance

This page is part of the generated PolyTerm documentation set and should stay aligned with the source module and command inventory.

When updating this feature:

- Confirm the linked source file still exists and the module name has not changed.
- Update command examples, TUI shortcuts, and option names when Click or controller routing changes.
- Keep data-source notes current with the active Polymarket API contracts.
- Prefer concrete endpoint names, identifier types, and output fields over broad marketing language.
- Run `./test_all_commands.sh` when a CLI command or shortcut is affected.
- Run `.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_docs.py` before committing documentation changes.

Validation expectations:

- Internal links should resolve inside the `docs/` tree.
- Examples should be copy-pasteable from the repository root unless stated otherwise.
- Pages for view-only workflows should say so when wallet or trading context is involved.
- Pages that depend on live market data should name Gamma, Data API, or CLOB as the source.
- Alias pages should point to the canonical page and explain why the alias exists.
- New modules should have a dedicated page rather than relying only on the index.
