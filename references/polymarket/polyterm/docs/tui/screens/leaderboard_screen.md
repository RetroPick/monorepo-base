# Leaderboard Screen

> View top traders ranked by profit, volume, win rate, or activity.

## Overview

The Leaderboard Screen shows trader rankings across Polymarket. You can view leaderboards sorted by different metrics and filtered by time period, or check your own ranking if you have a connected wallet.

## Access

- **Menu shortcut**: `lb`, `leaderboard`
- **Menu path**: Extended shortcuts menu

## What It Shows

A two-step selection flow:

1. **Leaderboard type** -- Top by Profit, Volume, Win Rate, Most Active, or My Ranking
2. **Time period** (except for My Ranking) -- 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or All time

## Navigation / Keyboard Shortcuts

- `1`-`5` to select leaderboard type
- `1`-`4` to select time period
- `b` to return to the main menu

## CLI Commands

| Option | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Top by profit (7d) | `polyterm leaderboard -t profit -p 7d` |
| Top by volume (24h) | `polyterm leaderboard -t volume -p 24h` |
| Top by win rate (30d) | `polyterm leaderboard -t winrate -p 30d` |
| Most active (all time) | `polyterm leaderboard -t active -p all` |
| My ranking | `polyterm leaderboard --me` |

## Documentation Maintenance

This page is part of the generated PolyTerm documentation set and should stay aligned with the source module and command inventory.

When updating this feature:

- Confirm the linked source file still exists and the module name has not changed.
- Update command examples, TUI shortcuts, and option names when Click or controller routing changes.
- Keep data-source notes current with the active Polymarket API contracts.
- Prefer concrete endpoint names, identifier types, and output fields over broad marketing language.
- Run `./test_all_commands.sh` when a CLI command or shortcut is affected.
- Run `.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_docs.py` before committing documentation changes.

Validation expectations:

- Internal links should resolve inside the `docs/` tree.
- Examples should be copy-pasteable from the repository root unless stated otherwise.
- Pages for view-only workflows should say so when wallet or trading context is involved.
- Pages that depend on live market data should name Gamma, Data API, or CLOB as the source.
- Alias pages should point to the canonical page and explain why the alias exists.
- New modules should have a dedicated page rather than relying only on the index.
